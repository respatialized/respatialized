# Example markdown file

## Rationale
As much as I wish I could forgo it entirely, I don't have the time to implement a full EBNF for my own markdown-like notation and still focus on speed for other things. This is fast for expressing my thoughts.

> It's also really hard to get better at having good ideas because you get such little feedback. It might take a year to build out a complex idea before finding out if it's good or not, which means you get maybe 40 attempts in your career.

> But if you can try out 10 ideas a year then you get 400 attempts. Having 10x as much feedback is a huge advantage in learning any complex skill.

Markdown is supported by many tools, but each of them extends it in many context-sensitive ways. Might as well lean into that by doing the same thing myself. Commonmark-hiccup might well support that.
