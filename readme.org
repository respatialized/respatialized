This repository contains code to generate a blog using ~perun~, a flexible static site generator written in Clojure and ~boot~.

The github repo is a read-only mirror of a single branch containing the public posts.

The gitlab repo uses ci/cd to auto-publish the blog. Here's how it works:
1. Posts are written in Markdown (for now).
2. ~boot build~  renders the files using ~perun~ into HTML in the ~target~ dir, the usual default for Java projects.
3. the contents of ~target~ get ~rsync~ ed to ~public~, the directory required by Gitlab Pages. 

For interactive development / writing, ~boot dev~ sets up a web server on localhost to serve up pages that are automatically re-rendered.
