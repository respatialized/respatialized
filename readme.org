This repository contains code to generate a blog using Matthew Butterick's ~pollen~ markup language and ~thenotepad~, Joel Dueck's extensions for it to make it more blog-friendly.

The github repo is a read-only mirror of a single branch containing the public posts.

The gitlab repo uses ci/cd to auto-publish the blog. Here's how it works:
1. Pollen source files are worked with in the ~build~ subdir. 
2. ~make publish~ renders the files into ~public~, the target required by Gitlab Pages.

The source code that generates this blog is licensed under the MIT License. See ~LICENSE.MD~ for more details.
