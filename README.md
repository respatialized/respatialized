# Respatialized

Clojure programmer, author of a handful of libraries:

- [Fabricate](https://fabricate.site/): a static website generator that lets you express website builds as Clojure programs rather than CLI tool config.
- [Adorn](https://adorn.fabricate.site/): an extensible tool for converting Clojure source code into Hiccup data structures while preserving more semantic information about the code.

This repo also contains the Fabricate source code for my own website, where I sometimes write essays about things like [YAML](https://respatialized.net/against-metadata.html), Wilkinson's [Grammar of Graphics as applied to Clojure](https://respatialized.net/syntax-of-graphics.html), and the [dread of the parking garage](https://respatialized.net/parking-garage-dread.html).

Occasionally I write more technical essays about topics like [using data schemas as keys to match the states of a finite state machine](https://fabricate.site/background/finite-schema-machines.html) or [measuring the performance of syntax highlighting](https://adorn.fabricate.site/performance.html).
