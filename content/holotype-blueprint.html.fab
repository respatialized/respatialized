Holotype will eventually become a library, distributable as an artifact separate from the context of its original creation. This page serves as a blueprint for that library.

✳=(blockquote
 {:source "Suffering-oriented programming"
  :url "http://nathanmarz.com/blog/suffering-oriented-programming.html"

    "First make it possible. Then make it beautiful. Then make it fast.")🔚

Following Marz's advice, there will be three major phases of the work needed to make ✳= (in-code "holotype")🔚 a reality.

✳=(header {:level :h3} "Possible")🔚

Because ✳= (in-code "holotype")🔚 exists mostly as idiosyncratic site generation code, I still need to make it ✳= (em "possible") 🔚 to use outside of the context of this website. As Marz suggests, I am still feeling out the problem space in the context of a working prototype based on concrete examples.

As an example of following Marz's lead in building the prototype atop concrete uses, I generated the table below from an ordered map of features defined inline:

✳= [:details

    [:summary "Table source map"]
    (code {:class "language-clojure"} (with-out-str (clojure.pprint/pprint features)))] 🔚
✳= [:details [:summary (in-code "respatialized.render/map->table")] (include-def (quote map->table) "./src/respatialized/render.clj")] 🔚

I didn't have that function before I wrote this post. Rather than writing a general-purpose 'table' function from scratch, I allowed the shape of the data that made the most sense at the time of writing to guide the implementation. A lot of this phase will consist of work like that: specific solutions that serve as data points for a new series of abstractions that unify the design.

✳=(header {:level :h3} "Beautiful")🔚

In this phase, API stability will allow for new features to be built on a stable foundation while maintaining extensibility. I consider it an important goal that the ✳=(in-code "holotype")🔚 code be usable as a ✳=(em "library")🔚, not as an opinionated and auto-configuring ✳=(em "framework")🔚, which is what I hope a disciplined approach to API design will allow.

✳=(header {:level :h3} "Fast")🔚

This phase will focus on improving the responsiveness of interactions with the library. Due to the importance of real-time feedback for users of the library, latency is to be prioritized over throughput.

✳=(header {:level :h3} "Table of features")🔚

✳= (map->table features :milestone) 🔚

✳=(header {:level :h3} "Features In Detail")🔚

✳=(header {:level :h4} "Error handling")🔚

Holotype features a parse and evaluate method that allows errors to be surfaced directly, in context. Here's an example:

✳=(invalid-fn :input)🔚

The error message encountered during the parse/eval step gets surfaced where the original source expression was in the page, allowing a user to quickly identify the cause and fix it. Particularly useful when paired with live page refreshing. Right now the focus is on allowing a user to see and respond to errors, but future work may add a machine-friendlier way of catching and responding to them.

✳=(header {:level :h4} "Autodocumentation")🔚

The separation of parsing and execution enables an interesting possibility: the self-documenting namespace. The expressions marked for evaluation without being included in the result – ✳= (in-code (str \< \% \space \% \>)) 🔚 – map more or less directly on to a namespace's core definitions, and expressions marked for inclusion – ✳= (in-code (str \< \% \= \space \% \>)) 🔚 – map on to expressions that can be safely ignored in the context of definining a namespace. This means that holotype could be used for literate programming as easily as for programmatic content generation.

Parsing the essential expressions out of a file and passing them directly to Clojure's reader + classpath resolver effectively ✳=(link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming#Concept" "tangles" )🔚 them without the need for intermediate files. Weaving could be accomplished using the database.
