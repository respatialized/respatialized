This post explores the idea of an extruder to create generative designs.

The simplest way to explore this concept in two dimensions is to implement extruded segments as a kind of constrained Brownian motion. The basic constraints:
âœ³=[:ul [:li "Segments have a fixed length"]
       [:li "Segments may not overlap or intersect with other segments"]]ğŸ”š
If a segment "hits" another, it can adjust its heading to continue. If it cannot continue without hitting another segment, then it stops.

Before it is completed, a segment must hold on to three pieces of state:
âœ³=[:ul [:li "The positions of other segments"]
[:li "Its current heading"]
[:li "Its remaining 'fuel' "]]ğŸ”š

âœ³(def segment [:+ [:schema [:cat :int :int]]])ğŸ”š
âœ³(def drawing-segment
  [:map
   [:segment segment]
   [:headings :map]
   [:heading [:fn fn?]]
   [:fuel :int]])ğŸ”š


âœ³=  [:h1 "Lambda, the ultimate GOTO"]ğŸ”š

Conceptually, a heading is just a function that takes a current position and returns the next position. Change this function, and you change the heading.

Alternatively, it could be a function that takes a position and heading and returns a position and heading.

âœ³(assert (m/validate segment [[1 2] [1 3]]))ğŸ”š

âœ³(assert (m/validate drawing-segment
                    {:segment [[1 2] [1 3]]
                     :heading (fn [[x y]] [(inc x) y])
                     :headings {(fn [[x y]] [(inc x) y])
                                (fn [[x y]] [x (inc y)])}
                     :fuel 20}))ğŸ”š

Using the latter concept, the idea of fuel can be generalized: if a segment has to change direction or collides with another segment, then more fuel can be consumed. This lets a segment pick the least expensive option. One assumption guiding this implementation: it's the job of a heading function to produce a new location, not to detect collisions or update fuel. That can only be done once you have a position to check!

This is a visual test to ensure the reducing functions that yield extruded segments work properly. I haven't yet developed a function to define the interaction between two segments in the way that matches my initial sketches, but reducing over a sequential collection of points is a powerful and general way of building up the segments, and defining the heading as a function is a clever way of anticipating and accomodating future changes.
