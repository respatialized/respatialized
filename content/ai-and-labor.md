Here's a linkdump on AI and labor:

Vi Hart, ["Changing My Mind on Universal Basic Income and AI"](https://theartofresearch.org/ai-ubi-and-data/)

Hart refers more directly to the real problem with AI than a lot of other commentary I've read.

> I’m reminded of something from our VR research days. A company I won’t name was frequently making the VR news with big claims about something their proprietary software could do algorithmically. Mathematically this seemed suspect to me. We met with a room full of young men pitching their technology with all the jargon in the book, but unable to answer basic questions that only someone in their field would know to ask. Months later at an event we ran into someone who worked there. Her job was to do by hand the thing they claimed their algorithm could do. The entire rest of the industry pretended she didn’t exist, and the company truly believed that any day now, maybe if they just hire one more rockstar developer, they’d finish up this algorithm they were pretending to have, so she wasn’t worth much anyway.

She doesn't refer to it in these terms specifically, but the dynamic is familiar to socialists: the reduction of skilled to simple labor via the production of fixed capital.
