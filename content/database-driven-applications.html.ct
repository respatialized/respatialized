At each component boundary, there lies the potential for an impedance mismatch: due to some technology or system constraint, some critical piece of the information model doesn't make it across the boundary.

<%= [:ol
     [:li (ul "The data model may be difficult to express in the constraints of the storage medium (e.g. SQL)"
              "The data model is expressed too concretely in the DB (e.g. JSON columns, document stores)")]
     [:li (ul "The data model may not match the constraints of the communication layer (e.g. REST/HTTP)"
              "The API only exposes a limited subset of the information model")]
    [:li (ul "The front end, as a privileged part of the application, gets to talk to the information model directly and bypass the API's limitations")]
    [:li (ul "The API exposed to external programs only sees a limited subset of the 'true' API")]] %>

Just let a program run queries against the database. Let me make a TODO on my TODO list by transacting an assertion.

In order for this to be a viable solution, several assumptions must hold:

<%= (ul "You need a very expressive query language. (sorry, SQL)"
       "You need to give the user unmediated access to their data. (sorry, webapps)"
       "'Scalability' is not a concern. (sorry, webapps)"
       "You need to parse and validate the query to eliminate pathological/hostile inputs. (sorry, SQL)") %>

In short, this solution really only works in the context of <%=(link "https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html" "local-first software")%>.
