# // RELAY

<div class="f4">
A relay isn't the source of a signal or information. It just helps the signal travel further and more accurately.
</div>

Usage modes:

- *SMS* - text a designated number from a designated number with a message, the relay puts the message in a database and saves the metadata. Programs using the database can use the relay to send messages back. 
  - <span class="f8"> _oblique strategy_: send a message with an oracular glyph in it to the relay, and at random the oracle program will send one of those glyphed messages back.</span>
- *API*
