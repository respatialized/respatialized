Chapter 2 introduces the distinction between the world of a model and the world in which that model is deployed. This can be thought of many ways, including the distinction between observed data and unobserved data, or perhaps more broadly, the difference between the data through which we observe the world and the real-world thing that we think is measured or represented by the data.

What he meant is that probability is a device for describing uncertainty from the perspective of an observer with limited knowledge; it has no objective reality. Discuss the globe tossing example from the chapter, in light of this statement. What does it mean to say \"the probability of water is 0.7\"?"]
      :answer/mine "In my interpretation, the statement \"the probability of water is 0.7\" means that, across multiple repeated tosses and catches of the globe, we would expect our index finger to be atop water 70% of the time, with our observed data tending to approach this ratio with further successive tosses. It means that any given individual toss has a significantly better than even chance of turning up water; water is the 'expected value' for an individual toss."}
