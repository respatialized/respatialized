Notes on AI and labor

- Moore's law gets soaked by exponential increases in the amount of CPU time to achieve linear improvements in ability of a model to perform its tasks.
- [OpenAI article admitting this]
- To the extent that AI gets "smarter", it's largely due to the fact that we're getting better at throwing more resources at the problem.
- [fact about carbon consumption of deep learning models]
- Back in the day we thought progress in AI would consist of individual computers doing better with less resources - that doesn't describe the "state of the art" at all.
- AI researchers like games because they provide a bounded problem space with immediate feedback. The real world is not as generous.
- So how do we get that feedback in the real world, at the scale required for massive distributed models to avoid overfitting? Data factories.
- [Vi Hart quotation about the human labor a SV company was pretending to perform with AI]
- Hart's essay doesn't say it in these terms, but she's talking about a theme familiar to Marxian economists - the reduction of skilled to simple labor by capital.

That's the dimension often overlooked: the labor dimension.
