âœ³=[:h2 "Goal 1: Reduce superfluous computation"]ðŸ”š

The simplest way to achieve this is to store a file hash and avoid re-rendering unchanged files. This method was used to render this post.

A more sophisticated way of doing this, that allows for more granularity in what gets persisted and recomputed, would be to "memoize" certain expressions, storing their input arguments and outputs in the database so they can be re-used. There are currently some âœ³=[:a {:href "https://github.com/repl-acement/editors"} "efforts"]ðŸ”š in the Clojure community to stitch together many of the same pieces that Fabricate is built from to realize this concept in a powerful and general way.

âœ³=[:h2 "Goal 2: Be fully reconstructible"]ðŸ”š

The second goal, in tension with the first, is that the database should not be the "source of truth" for the static site. The history of pages can be rebuilt from Git, should the database file ever get corrupted.

âœ³=[:h4 "What about things that don't need to be saved as individual files, like small SVG glyphs?"]ðŸ”š

Git can still be the source of truth for those, I believe, if âœ³=[:a {:href "https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects"} [:code "git hash-object"]]ðŸ”š is used correctly.


âœ³=[:h2 "Goal 3: Grant the author leverage"]ðŸ”š

âœ³=[:em "See: " [:a {:href "/not-a-tree.html"} "Structur and Alpha"] ", the writing tools employed by John McPhee for his books, implemented as extensions for Kedit"]ðŸ”š

If a database is to have broader use beyond just speeding up the page generation process, it needs to become part of the writing experience.

It should permit queries like "show me every quotation appearing in one of my writings, organized by the page it appears on." Most static website generators are unambitious in this regard, embracing a 1:1 model of "input file" â†’ "output page" that makes seeing âœ³=[:em "across"]ðŸ”š writing difficult or impossible beyond your basic browser control+F.

The database, in short, should support the creation and maintenance of the "organized system" that digital writing and generative art is so often âœ³=[:em "not"]ðŸ”š a part of.

Here's an example of that power to find quotations:

âœ³+= (archive/query->table
    '[:find
         ?title ?q
         :where
         [?p :respatialized.writing/title ?title]
         [?p ?a* ?e]
         (or [?e :html/tag :blockquote]
             [?e :html/tag :q])
         [?e ?a2* ?q]
         [(string? ?q)]]
    (d/db archive/test-db)
    {:col-renames {'?title "Title" '?fp "input file path"}})ðŸ”š



âœ³=[:h2 "Concept: Reconstructing history"]ðŸ”š

Where goals 2 and 3 intersect is where things get really tricky. If the database becomes corrupted, how can it be reconstructed without repeatedly re-evalutating every revision of every file? The queries depend upon some state of the world that may not exist anymore, and is potentially expensive to recompute.

For one thing, that may not actually be a problem if the pages can be re-evaluated asynchronously. The object hash provided by git already also gives a deduplication mechanism if used intelligently.

âœ³=[:pre [:code "(query! all-quotes-query)"]]ðŸ”š
This query would need to capture its revision hash at time of execution for reproducibility. If a query tries to reach a commit not in the DB, that revision can be checked out and re-evaluated.



âœ³=[:h4 "One way of implementing this: " [:code "konserve-git"]]ðŸ”š

The general idea is that git would still handle all the plumbing and Datahike would be a kind of cache or porcelain atop it, giving users Clojure and fabricate-specific query capabilities. Might be unfeasible for performance reasons, as content-addressed files accessed through git may not be fast enough for real queries (counterexample: sqlite). Evaluated pages/forms could be stored directly in git using write-object, providing the caching mechanism for results.

âœ³=[:h2 "Implementation Choices"]ðŸ”š


âœ³=[:h3 "Database: Asami"]ðŸ”š


Asami is the database to use right now, for the following reasons:

âœ³= (ol "Powerful graph model" "First-class support for transitive relations"
      "Schemaless, but able to enforce a uniqueness constraint for individual entities via :db/ident"  "Open-world assumption about relations" "On-disk storage") ðŸ”š


âœ³=[:h3 "Relational Model"]ðŸ”š

For the time being, the following property is assumed of all posts: 1 input file, 1 post, 1 output page. Top-level metadata are encoded as attributes of the page. Sub-page elements are modeled as descendent entities.


âœ³=[:h4 "Modeling history"]ðŸ”š

Asami doesn't have the same query semantics as Datomic, so queries cannot use 
âœ³=[:em :db/txInstant]ðŸ”š to query across the history of values for an attribute. This means that time needs to be modeled explicitly via attributes rather than implicitly using the database's underlying history storage mechanism. As I understand it, this is already  âœ³=[:a {:href "https://vvvvalvalval.github.io/posts/2017-07-08-Datomic-this-is-not-the-history-youre-looking-for.html"} "best practice" ]ðŸ”š for any "human time" attributes (as opposed to "system time") for Datomic, so the effort put in to thinking through this problem will make the resulting database design more robust.

âœ³=[:h2 "Experiments with a live database"]ðŸ”š

At present, the database is rather simplistic, consisting of page data without a relational model applied to the page contents.

Can we run transformers on that simple content to produce things?


âœ³=[:h2 "Indexing the site"]ðŸ”š

In the more old-school sense of the phrase "index."

âœ³+= (archive/query->table
    '[:find ?title ?fp
      :where
      [?e :file/path ?fp]
      [?e :respatialized.writing/title ?title]] (d/db archive/db)
    {:col-renames {'?title "Title" '?fp "input file path"}})ðŸ”š


âœ³=[:h2 "A potential problem: cycles"]ðŸ”š

What about cycles? Pages' contents may be added to the database as data, then queried by other pages. If a page's content query adds more content or is self-referential (e.g. it inserts a quote element as a quote, which then gets queried), then there is a potential for an infinite loop.
