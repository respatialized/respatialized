Solution for persisting “Windows created a temporary paging file on your computer” error

My Windows 7 laptop began displaying a notification/error every time I logged in:

◊blockquote{
◊code{Windows created a temporary paging file on your computer because of a problem that  occured with your paging file configuration when you started your computer. The total paging  file size for all disk drives may be somewhat larger than the size you specified}
}

After clicking OK, it would open the virtual memory settings without any explanation of what you were supposed to check or do there.

This evidently happens because ◊code{pagefile.sys}, the file that Windows uses for virtual memory, has become corrupted in some way.

◊link["http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-7-virtual-memory-keeps-resetting-on/e7ba857a-ba74-4978-9ea7-0c929f75a19d"]{This Microsoft Answers article} recommends running a system file check. Here’s ◊link["http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212/en-us"]{how to run an SFC}. This did not solve the problem for me, but it is something you should try first.

Here’s how I cleared it up:

◊ol{
◊item{Log in under a local Administrator account. (Do this after each restart in these instructions as well.)}
◊item{If it’s not already open, open the virtual memory settings by rich-clicking on Computer, → ◊code{Properties} → ◊code{Advanced System Settings} → click the ◊code{Advanced} tab → Under Performance, click ◊code{Settings}, go to ◊code{Advanced} tab, finally under Virtual Memory section click the ◊code{Change} button.}
◊item{Uncheck the ◊code{Autmatically manage paging file size for all drives} checkbox.}
◊item{Set a “Custom size” for the paging file on the C drive: 0MB initial, 0MB maximum.}
◊item{Click OK, close all dialog boxes, and restart your computer.}
◊item{After logging in again, delete the file ◊code{C:\pagefile.sys}

◊ol{
◊item{To do this, you may need to change your folder settings so you can see it first. Open a window of your C: drive and click ◊code{Organize} at the top, then ◊code{Folder and Search Options}}
◊item{Click the ◊code{View} tab, and make sure ◊code{Show hidden files, folders and drives} is turned on, and that ◊code{Hide protected system files} is ◊strong{not} checked.}
◊item{Click OK and go back to your C: drive, find ◊code{pagefile.sys} and delete it.}
}}
◊item{Now go back to the virtual memory settings (see step 2 above) and set the paging file for the C: drive to ◊code{System managed size}, and then make sure the ◊code{Automatically manage paging file size for all drives} checkbox is ◊strong{checked}.}
◊item{Click OK, close all dialog boxes, and restart your computer.}
}

◊strong{A summary of what this does:} By temporarily turning off virtual memory, you allow yourself to delete the (now-corrupt) paging file. Then when you re-enable virtual memory, Windows automatically builds a new paging file from scratch, and ◊emph{voilà}, problem solved.

I was helped by ◊link["http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/topic/41071-paging-file-is-gone%3B-correspondng-error-at-startup/"]{this thread at geekstogo.com} although I did not find it necessary to do any editing of the Registry or any of that jazz. Try the simplest solution first, I always say.

I had the same problem, and I was able to delete the file by restarting on Safe Mode. Hope it helps!}

I’d tried several other solutions, including both the SFC and the “sc config afs start= disabled” command, and none of them worked. This one did - and better still, I actually understood what I was doing!}

What else do you recommend? Is there a program running in the background (a “process” in the “Task Manager”) that I should kill first?}

If you running an HyperV Gen1 VM and getting this message please check that the VHD is not mounted as an ISCSI drive or else the problem will also persist. it needs to be mounted as an Traditional hard drive for the OS to write the Pagefile.}
