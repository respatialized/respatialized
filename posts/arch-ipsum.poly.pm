◊h3{Prejudices against earth as a building material}

(excerpted from ◊a[#:href "https://archive.org/details/Gernot_Minke-Building_With_Earth/page/n11"]{Gernot Minke- Building With Earth})

Owing to ignorance, prejudices against loam are still widespread. Many people have difficulty conceiving that a natural building material such as earth need not be processed and that, in many cases, the excavation for foundations provides a material that can be used directly in building. The following reaction by a mason who had to build an adobe wall is characteristic: "This is like medieval times; now we have to dirty our hands with all this mud." The same mason, happily showing his hands after working with adobes for a week, said, "Have you ever seen such smooth mason's hands? The adobes are a lot of fun to handle as there are no sharp corners."

◊h3{General}
Loam is a product of erosion from rock in the earth's crust. This erosion occurs mainly through the mechanical grinding of rock via the movement of glaciers, water and wind, or through thermal expansion and contraction of rock, or through the expansion of freezing water in the crevices of the rock. Due to organic acids prevalent in plants, moreover, chemical reactions due to water and oxygen also lead to rock erosion. The composition and varying properties of loam depend on local conditions. Gravelly mountainous loams, for instance, are more suitable for rammed earth (provided they contain sufficient clay), while riverside loams are often siltier and are therefore less weather-resistant and weaker in compression. Loam is a mixture of clay, silt and sand, and sometimes contains larger aggregates like gravel and stones. Engineering science defines its particles according to diameter: particles with diameters smaller than 0.002 mm are termed clay, those between 0.002 and 0.06 mm are called silt, and those between 0.06 and 2 mm are called sand. Particles of larger diameter are termed gravels and stones. Like cement in concrete, clay acts as a binder for all larger particles in the loam. Silt, sand and aggregates constitute the fillers in the loam. Depending on which of the three components is dominant, we speak of a clayey, silty or sandy loam. In traditional soil mechanics, if the clay content is less than 15% by weight, the soil is termed a lean clayey soil. If it is more than 30% by weight, it is termed a rich clayey soil. Components that form less than 5% of the total by weight are not mentioned when naming the soils. Thus, for instance, a rich silty, sandy, lean clayey soil contains more than 30% silt, 15% to 30% sand, and less than 15% clay with less than 5% gravel or rock. However, in earth construction engineering, this method of naming soils is less accurate because, for example, a loam with 14% clay which would be called lean clayey in soil mechanics, would be considered a rich clayey soil from the point of view of earth construction.

◊h3{Organic constituents}
Soil dug from depths of less than 40 cm usually contains plant matter and humus (the product of rotting plants), which consists mainly of colloidal particles and is acidic (pH-value less than 6). Earth as building material should be free of humus and plant matter. Under certain conditions, plant matter like straw can be added, provided it is dry and there is no danger of later deterioration (see p. 83).
◊h3{Water}

Water activates the binding forces of loam. Besides free water, there are three different types of water in loam: water of crystallisation (structural water), absorbed water, and water of capillarity (pore water). Water of crystallisation is chemically bound and is only distinguishable if the loam is heated to temperatures between 400°C and 900°C Absorbed water is electrically bound to the clay minerals. Water of capillarity has entered the pores of the material by capillary action. Absorbed and capillary water are released when the mixture is heated to 105°C If dry clay gets wet, it swells because water creeps in between the lamellary structure, surrounding the lamellas with a thin film of water. If this water evaporates, the interlamellary distance is reduced, and the lamellas arrange themselves in a parallel pattern due to the forces of electrical attraction. The clay thus acquires a "binding force" (see p. 32), if in a plastic state, and compressive and tensile strength after drying.
