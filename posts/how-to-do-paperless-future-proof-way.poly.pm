◊(define-meta published "2013-01-24")
◊(define-meta topics "paperless,scanning,PDF")

The short version:

◊ul{
◊item{Get a ◊amazon["B008ASBFM6"]{Doxie One scanner}. For (optional) convenience, get an ◊amazon["B003DV4234"]{Eye-Fi SD card} for $35, which will send documents from the scanner to your computer wirelessly and automatically.

◊strong{Update:} If you want to cut your scanning time by more than half, spend a few bucks more and get the ◊amazon["B00671E4B2"]{Canon P-215 scanner} (as ◊link["http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-portable-scanner-is-the-canon-p-215/"]{recommended} by The Wirecutter). It scans twice as fast, it scans both sides of the page at the same time, it has a document feeder, and it has built-in OCR.}
◊item{Scan your documents to your hard drive. Put them all in one big folder. If you want, use the OCR option in Doxie’s software to make your PDFs searchable.}
◊item{Date and tag the documents: use this format for filenames:
◊code{[year]-[month] name of document #tag1 #tag2 #tag3.pdf}}
◊item{Get an ◊link["http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/office-products/1069596/?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=thloya-20"]{expanding file jacket}. Put all your important papers in there and out of the way, and scan them all once every quarter or so (I usually do my scans once a year just before I do my taxes).}
◊item{Shred the original documents.}
◊item{Keep backups.}
}

When you want to run a search, open your archive folder and run a search. Need all tax-related documents for last year? Search for ◊code{2012 #taxes}.

No subscriptions. No extra software. Guaranteed to be stay portable and useful for the next 20 years.

◊section{Why the hashtags? What about folders?}

Using ◊code{#tags #like #this} in the filename is a universal tagging mechanism. It works on Mac OS and on Windows, and the searches on those systems will have no problem finding your files.

Sticking files in a folder hierarchy is a poor way of filing that is on its way out. For example, what do you do if a document is both medical and tax-related in nature? Do you create a ◊code{Taxes → Medical} folder structure, or ◊code{Medical → Taxes}?

Tags allow a document to live in more than one box at a time, are easy to add, and are easy to search for.

◊section{Why Not Evernote? Reasons, that’s why.}

There have been a ◊link["http://shawnblanc.net/2012/09/the-paperless-puzzel/"]{couple} of ◊link["http://toolsandtoys.net/the-tools-and-toys-paperless-guide/"]{great} ◊link["http://lifehacker.com/5973033/how-i-turned-three-years-of-paper-into-a-highly-organized-searchable-document-database-in-two-days"]{posts} by others lately about going paperless, and they’re definitely worth reading. But they all assume you need some kind of fancy software setup, including (most commonly) a subscription plan to Evernote.

I agree it must be nice to have someone else run OCR on my documents and host them for me. But let’s look at the drawbacks:

◊ul{
◊item{I have to pay someone else $60 a year in case I need to perform occasional full-text searches on my own documents.}
◊item{Long-term uncertainty. Will Evernote be around in 10 years? 20 years? How do I know I’ll be able to get my massive archive back out again when they go out of business?}
◊item{Handing off responsibility for your sensitive documents to someone else’s computers — this is just asking for trouble. Data corruption, security breaches, warrantless searches. Over the next 10 years, it’s almost a given that your hosted service of choice will be hit by at least one of them.}

I have a question about your tags. Does your file name really look like you suggest in your format? If yes, how do you search these files in Windows OS? I do have Everything installed and use it quite often, still I can’t figure out, how can I use hashtags to search? Any pointers?
Thanks in advance.}

Better yet, if OCR has done its job properly, your PDFs content will all be indexed by Spotlight already (this has existed since 10.4 Tiger in 2004, I believe) : you can just search for them from anywhere on your Mac.

The indexing / OCR features of Evernote are really useful for Windows users who lack all of that functionality built into the OS.}
