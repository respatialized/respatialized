◊(define-meta title "The 50 Books Every Child Should Read")
◊(define-meta published "2011-06-16")

The Independent recently asked three of Britain’s leading children’s authors and two of their in-house book experts to each pick 10 books, suitable for Year 7 students. Their original list is ◊link["http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/the-50-books-every-child-should-read-2250138.html"]{here}.

Unfortunately, in typical traditional-media fashion, they neglected to add any links to any of the books mentioned, losing an obvious opportunity to use the web to both their readers’ and their own advantage. So I have gone through the list and added links to the Kindle editions of every book for which one is available.

I linked to a free edition wherever possible. If a book was not available on the Kindle store, I marked it with an ◊color["red"]{*} asterisk. If you know of a Kindle version of a book I could not find, or of a free or better-formatted edition than the one I have linked, let me know via email or comments!
