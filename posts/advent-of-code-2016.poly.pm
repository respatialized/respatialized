I’m giving this year’s ◊link["http://adventofcode.com"]{Advent of Code} event a shot.

Since I’m also using this as a way of learning a little about ◊link["http://adventofcode.com"]{literate programming}, the programs I write are also web pages describing themselves. I’m uploading those web pages to ◊link["/projects/aoc2016"]{a subsection of this site}, where you can read my solutions and watch my progress.
